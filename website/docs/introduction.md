# Introduction to LoadShedding

‚ö°Ô∏è LoadShedding was designed to effectively manage concurrency in the .NET ecosystem. 

üèó Built upon the foundational principles and concepts pioneered by [Netflix](https://netflixtechblog.medium.com/performance-under-load-3e6fa9a60581).

üéÅ Offers out-of-the-box Adaptative Concurrency Limiter implementation.

üéÅ Offers additional features like metrics, request prioritization, and configuration flexibility. 

Get started by installing [LoadShedding](getting-started/installation) or following our [Quickstart](getting-started/quickstart).

## Features {#features}

Our goal is to empower you to build .NET apllications that preserve an acceptable quality of service for the maximum number of requests possible when a service is facing high demand or extreme load.

To do that, LoadShedding gives you access to features like:

- [Adaptative concurrency limiter](guides/adaptative-concurreny-limiter/adaptative_concurrency_limiter.md)
- [Events listenters](guides/adaptative-concurreny-limiter/configuration.md#events-listener-configuration)
- [Custom queue size calculator](guides/adaptative-concurreny-limiter/configuration.md#custom-queue-size-calculator-configuration)
- [Request prioritization](guides/adaptative-concurreny-limiter/configuration.md#request-prioritization-configuration)
- [Adaptative concurrency limiter metrics](guides/adaptative-concurreny-limiter/configuration.md#metrics)
